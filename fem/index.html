            Using a < main > tag inside the < body > of your HTML is a best
            practice because it clearly identifies the main content of your
            page. This helps with accessibility and improves how search engines
            understand your content.

            Using a full modern CSS reset is beneficial because it removes
            default browser styling, creating a consistent starting point for
            your design across all browsers. It helps avoid unexpected layout
            issues and makes your styles more predictable, ensuring a uniform
            appearance on different devices and platforms, check out this site

            While px is useful for precise, fixed sizing, such as border-width,
            border-radius, inline-padding, and <img /> sizes, it has
            limitations. Pixels don't scale well with user settings or adapt to
            different devices, which can negatively impact accessibility and
            responsiveness. For example, using px for font sizes can make text
            harder to read on some screens, Check this article
            <a href="https://fedmentor.dev/posts/font-size-px/"
              >why font-size must NEVER be in pixels</a
            >. In contrast, relative units like rem and adjust based on the
            user’s preferences and device settings, making your design more
            flexible and accessible. Use px where exact sizing is needed, but
            prefer relative units for scalable layouts. If you want a deeper
            explanation watch this video by Kevin Powell

              >CSS em and rem explained</a
            >. Another great resource I found useful is this px to rem converter
            based on the default font-size of 16 pixel.

            Using position: absolute is not always best practice because it
            removes elements from the normal document flow, making layouts
            harder to manage and potentially causing overlap or misalignment on
            different screen sizes. Instead, use flexible layout techniques like
            CSS Grid or Flexbox for more responsive and maintainable designs.

            For future project, You could download and host your own fonts using
            @font-face improves website performance by reducing external
            requests, provides more control over font usage, ensures consistency
            across browsers, enhances offline availability, and avoids potential
            issues if third-party font services become unavailable.

            These < div > should really have semantic tags like headings (< h1 >
            to < h6 >) and paragraphs (< p >) convey structure and meaning to
            content, improving accessibility, SEO, and readability by helping
            search engines and screen readers interpret the content.

          <li>
            Using rem or em units in @media queries is better than px because
            they are relative units that adapt to user settings, like their
            preferred font size. This makes your design more responsive and
            accessible, ensuring it looks good on different devices and respects
            user preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using id selectors for styling in CSS because they are too
            specific and hard to override, making your styles less flexible and
            maintainable. Instead, use class selectors (.), which are reusable
            and more manageable, allowing for better control over your styles
            and easier updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using font-display: swap in your @font-face rule improves
            performance by showing fallback text until the custom font loads,
            preventing a blank screen (flash of invisible text). The downside is
            a brief flash when the font switches, but it’s usually better than
            waiting for text to appear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line height is usually unitless to scale proportionally with the
            font size, keeping text readable across different devices. Best
            practice is to use a unitless value like 1.5 for flexibility. Avoid
            using fixed units like px or %, as they don't adapt well to changes
            in font size or layout.

            Having a clear and descriptive alt text for images is important
            because it helps people who use screen readers understand the
            content, making your site more accessible. It also improves SEO, as
            search engines use alt text to understand the image's context,
            helping your site rank better, Check this out

            This should be in lowercase < h4
            class="content__subheading">PERFUME< /h4> and styled in CSS with
            text-transform: uppercase;, Keeping text lowercase in HTML improves
            accessibility and SEO. Using text-transform: uppercase; in CSS
            separates content from style, ensuring screen readers interpret the
            text correctly.
